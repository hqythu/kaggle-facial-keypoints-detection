%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   In this report we building an neural network for carrying out facial
   keypoints detection problem. We have tried several ways, but a problem
   of non convergence still need to be resolved, which till now we have no
   idea about that.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

This task comes originally from Kaggle\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/},
a online website holding many data science competitions. It's aim is to
determine the location of several certain key points on face, given a photograph
contains a human face.

This key points detection can form the building block for many applications. Such as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[*] tracking faces in images and video
		\item[*] analysing facial expressions
		\item[*] detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
		\item[*] biometrics / face recognition
	\end{itemize}
Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem. 
Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another,
and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation
due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions.
Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties,
but there remain many opportunities for improvement.

In this specific competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection}, 
we are required to localize 15 facial key points given a images. Each predicted point
is specified as $(x,y)$ real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices.
The 15 keypoints is: 

left\_eye\_center, right\_eye\_center, left\_eye\_inner\_corner, left\_eye\_outer\_corner, right\_eye\_inner\_corner, right\_eye\_outer\_corner, left\_eyebrow\_inner\_end, left\_eyebrow\_outer\_end, right\_eyebrow\_inner\_end, right\_eyebrow\_outer\_end, nose\_tip, mouth\_left\_corner, mouth\_right\_corner, mouth\_center\_top\_lip, mouth\_center\_bottom\_lip

so 30 real value is going to be predicted for each input image.

Kaggle given a training data set of 7049 image with size of $96*96$,
color is gray scale and represented as an integer from 0 to 255 for each
pixel. And each training images is labeled with 30 real value for position of the 
15 key points. In some examples, some of the target keypoint positions are misssing.

Also, a test set of 1783 images without label is given, for competitors to submit their
predicted result to Kaggle for score.

Performance is graded by MSE(mean square error) for those 30 real values. A lower
MSE indicate a better prediction.

In our work, we have carried out experiment on several models, include basic multilayer
perceptron, convolutional neural network and cascaded convolutional network.


\section{Related Work}

\section{Technical Approach}
In this section we demonstrate some technical approach which, based on previous
work, can improve performance of the network, accelerate convergence, and reduce
overfitting.

\subsection{Data Normalization}
In the original training data, each pixel is represented by an integer from 0 to 255,
and the real-value label range from 0 to 96. This large range of input and target data
may force the neuron to saturate, which slow down convergence. Also, the non-error-centered
target value make the full connected layer hard to get a ideal output.

In our implementation, gray scale from 0 to 255 are divided by 256, rescaled to range 0 to 1,
and target value are rescaled and zero centered to range from -1 to 1. Let train\_x, train\_y
stand for the image data and label, the normalize preprocess looks like:
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		train\_x &= \frac{train\_x}{256.0} \\
		train\_y &= \frac{train\_y - 48.0}{48.0}
	\end{aligned}
$$

\subsection{ReLU Nonlinearity}
When training deep feedforward neural network, gradient diminishing when back propagation
often occurs and make it very slow to converge. This issue is common when using sigmoid-like
activation function, since they have a so-called saturation regime where gradient almost vanished.
According to experiment by Glorot \cite{glorot2010understanding}, for a feedforward neural net
with 4 layers and activate with sigmoid function, the last hidden layer quickly saturate with
output value of 0, which slow down the process of learning. and after a hundred of epochs,
it escaped, and the followed layer began to saturate.

Glorot hypothesize that this behavior is the result of combination of random initialization
and the fact that an output of zero correspond to a saturated sigmoid. Unsupervised pre-training
can successfully solve this issue.

While with another kind of activation function, known as ReLU(rectify linear unit), the problem
of saturation and gradient diminishing is also solved. ReLU activation act as follow:

$$
rectify(x) = max(x, 0)
$$

It can achieve the performance as better
as a pre-trained sigmoid network\cite{glorot2011deep} without any unsupervised pre-training.
It behavior is also more plausible at the viewpoint of biological neural science, which claim
a neuron to be closed below zero, and behave linearly when input is above zero with in some range,
and this range is satisfied most of time.

Also rectifier activation function allow a network to easily obtain sparse representations, which
is biologically plausible and have mathematical advantages.

The non-linearity when using rectify comes from path-selection. For different input, different
set of neurons are active. This model can be viewed as an \emph{exponential
number of linear models that share parameters}\cite{nair2010rectified}.

Experiment shows both improvement on learning speed and performance
\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, glorot2011deep}.

In our model, both the convolution layer and the full connected layer is activate by ReLU function
except for the last layer, which followed by the finally loss layer. Because we want the output
result to have both positive and negative value, while ReLU only result in positive and zero.

Also this approach can be used in classification problem with softmax and cross entropy loss.
Allow result to be negative increase the difference when doing softmax, which result in better
classification result.

\begin{comment}
\section{Introduction}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Dual submission}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2015 web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

\subsection{Paper length}
For CVPR 2015, the rules about paper length have changed, so please
read this section carefully. Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section
will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages
with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
{\bf Unlike previous years, there will be no extra page charges for
  CVPR 2015.}

Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.  This includes papers
where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly
altered from those laid down by this style guide.  Note that this
\LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for
supervised revisions of manuscripts.  The reviewing process cannot determine
the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is
reviewed in eleven.  

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
the \verb'\cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)  Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
--- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would
expect that the approximate location will be adequate.

\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.


\subsection{Blind review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind
review.  Blind review does not mean that one must remove
citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to
review a paper unless the previous citations are known and
available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our''
when citing previous work.  That is all.  (But see below for
techreports.)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say
that you are Lucy Smith; it says that you are building on her
work.  If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in
[7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the
paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our
   previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all
   previously known methods.  Why the previous paper was
   accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review
\end{quote}


An example of an acceptable paper:

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of the
   paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to
   all previously known methods.  Why the previous paper
   was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo
   filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''.
   Nature 381(12), 1-213.
\end{quote}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time,
which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that
submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you
had previously published related work.  In such cases, include the
anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as additional material and
cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324,
Supplied as additional material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material. 

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.

FAQ: Are acknowledgements OK?  No.  Leave them for the final copy.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2015 web page for a discussion
of the use of color in your document.

\section{Final copy}

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit
your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be
published in the proceedings.
